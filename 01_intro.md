# Types of Machine Learning

Based on following criteria
* Whether or not they are trained with human supervision
  * __Supervised__
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    * Decision Trees and Random Forests
    * Neural networks2
  * __Unsupervised__
    * Clustering 
      * K-Means
      * DBSCAN
      * Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
    * Anomaly detection and novelty detection
      * One-class SVM
      * Isolation Forest
    * Visualization and dimensionality reduction
      * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      * Kernel PCA
      * Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
      * t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    * Association rule learning
      * Apriori
      * Eclat
  * __Semisupervised__
  * __Reinforcement Learning__
* Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly
  * Online 
  * Batch learning (offline learning)
* Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model
  * Instance-based 
  * Model-based
